## Dashboard Overview

The Scenographist dashboard is designed to feel familiar, intuitive, and focused on creative flow.  
If you’ve used ChatGPT before, you’ll recognize the core interaction model — enhanced for **spatial design, scenography, and world-building**.

The dashboard is organized around three main areas:
- The chat workspace
- Drag-and-drop inputs and outputs
- The project sidebar

---

### Chat Workspace

At the center of the dashboard is the **chat channel**.

This is where you:
- Write prompts
- Refine ideas iteratively
- Generate scenes, variations, and technical outputs
- Give follow-up instructions (“make it darker”, “increase scale”, “change materials”)

Think of the chat as a **design conversation**, not a one-shot command.  
Each message builds on the previous one, allowing scenes to evolve naturally.

The chat supports:
- Natural language prompting
- Iterative refinement
- Context-aware follow-ups
- Scene evolution over time

---

### Drag & Drop

Scenographist supports drag-and-drop to ground prompts in real references.

You can drag:
- Images (moodboards, references, textures)
- Sketches or diagrams
- Plans or layouts
- Previously generated outputs

Dragged items can be referenced directly in chat:
- “Use the uploaded image as material inspiration”
- “Base the layout on the dragged sketch”
- “Match the lighting mood of the reference”

This allows prompts to combine **language + visual intent**, improving precision and coherence.

---

### Projects Sidebar

On the left side of the dashboard is the **Projects sidebar**.

Projects help you:
- Organize work by concept, client, or production
- Keep conversations and scenes grouped
- Revisit and iterate on previous explorations
- Maintain narrative and design continuity

Each project contains:
- Its own chat history
- Uploaded references
- Generated scenes and variations

This makes it easy to move between ideas without losing context.

---

### Typical Workflow

A common workflow looks like this:
- Create or select a project
- Start prompting in the chat
- Drag in references as needed
- Iterate through variations
- Refine toward a chosen direction
- Continue building or export when ready

You are never locked into a single output — everything remains editable and conversational.

---

### Design Philosophy

The dashboard is intentionally minimal.

It is built to:
- Reduce friction
- Encourage exploration
- Support spatial thinking
- Keep focus on intent, not tools

Scenographist is not about buttons and settings —  
it is about **thinking in spaces, scenes, and experiences**.
