## Mood, Era, Culture, Physics
Creating a world goes beyond space—it’s about establishing the context, rules, and atmosphere that make an environment feel alive and coherent. Scenographers use:

- **Mood:** Define the emotional tone of the environment through lighting, color, materials, and sound  
- **Era:** Evoke a specific historical period, future vision, or timeless aesthetic  
- **Culture:** Incorporate cultural references, symbolism, and narrative cues that resonate with the audience  
- **Physics:** Decide how the world “works”—its scale, gravity, movement rules, and interactions—to create believable and immersive experiences  

By combining these elements, designers can craft environments that feel real, lived-in, and consistent, giving visitors a sense of place, context, and story from the moment they enter.
