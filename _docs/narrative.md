## Visitor Flow, Emotional Progression
Narrative and journey shape how visitors experience a space over time. Scenographers design sequences that control attention, pacing, and emotional impact:

- **Visitor Flow:** Plan pathways, sightlines, and transitions to guide movement naturally and intuitively  
- **Emotional Progression:** Craft moments of tension, release, surprise, or calm to evoke desired emotional responses  

By combining flow and emotional rhythm, designers create immersive journeys where each step feels intentional, meaningful, and memorable.
