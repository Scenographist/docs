## Best Practices for First Prompts

The first prompt sets the tone for the entire project.  
It doesn’t need to be perfect — it needs to be **clear, intentional, and open to evolution**.

Strong first prompts create momentum without locking you in too early.

---

### Start with Intent, Not Detail

Focus on **why the space exists**, not how it looks.

Good first prompts describe:
- Purpose
- Context
- Emotional direction

Avoid starting with:
- Exact materials
- Technical constraints
- Highly specific styles

Let those emerge through iteration.

---

### Define the Emotion Early

Emotion anchors all later decisions.

Ask yourself:
- How should this space feel?
- What emotional state should it create?

Even one emotional word is enough:
- Calm
- Tense
- Sacred
- Playful

Emotion provides coherence from the start.

---

### Keep the Space Type Clear

Be explicit about what kind of space you are creating.

Examples:
- Immersive exhibition
- Performance environment
- Wedding ceremony space
- Temporary pavilion
- Hospitality arrival sequence

This helps Scenographist infer scale, circulation, and spatial logic.

---

### Use Natural Language

Write prompts as if you were explaining the idea to a collaborator.

Avoid:
- Overly technical phrasing
- Keyword stacking
- Formulaic syntax

Clear language leads to clearer spaces.

---

### One Idea per Prompt

Early prompts should focus on a **single core idea**.

Avoid combining:
- Multiple moods
- Conflicting styles
- Unrelated narratives

Clarity beats complexity.

---

### Let Iteration Do the Work

Your first prompt is not a final instruction.

Expect to follow up with:
- “Make it more intimate”
- “Reduce visual noise”
- “Increase verticality”

This is how scenes mature.

---

### Example First Prompt

Example:
Immersive exhibition space exploring memory and time, designed to feel quiet and introspective.

Simple. Focused. Enough to begin.

---

### Common First-Prompt Mistakes

- Trying to design everything at once
- Using too many adjectives
- Copying long reference-heavy prompts
- Treating the first output as final

---

### Mental Model

The first prompt opens the door.  
Iteration defines the path.

Start simple. Let the space speak back.
