## Mixing Architecture & Scenography
Blending architecture with scenography creates spaces that are both functional and emotionally engaging. By integrating structural design with storytelling, designers craft environments that resonate on multiple levels:

- **Spatial Narrative:** Use architectural elements to support the story and guide visitor perception  
- **Functional & Experiential:** Balance practical requirements with emotional impact and immersion  
- **Material & Light Synergy:** Combine textures, finishes, and lighting to enhance both structure and atmosphere  
- **Flexible Design:** Incorporate modularity and adaptability to allow spaces to evolve with usage or narrative  

By merging these disciplines, environments become holistic experiences—where form, function, and emotion coexist seamlessly.
