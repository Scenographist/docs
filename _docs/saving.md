## Saving, Exporting & Sharing

Scenographist is designed to support the full lifecycle of a spatial idea —  
from early exploration to communication and handover.

Saving, exporting, and sharing ensure your work remains accessible, usable, and transferable.

---

### Saving Your Work

All work in Scenographist is saved **automatically** within each project.

This includes:
- Chat conversations
- Iterations and refinements
- Uploaded references
- Generated scenes and variations

There is no need for manual saves.  
Your project acts as a continuous record of design thinking.

---

### Version Awareness

While you iterate, Scenographist keeps track of:
- Earlier scene generations
- Alternative directions
- Key decision points

This allows you to:
- Revisit previous versions
- Compare iterations
- Restore or continue from an earlier state

Iteration never overwrites intent.

---

### Exporting Scenes

Exporting allows you to move from exploration to communication.

Depending on your workflow, exports can be used for:
- Concept decks
- Client presentations
- Design reviews
- Production handover

Exports focus on **clarity of intent**, not raw data.

---

### What to Export

You can export:
- Individual scenes
- Selected variations
- Entire project narratives

Before exporting, consider:
- Who the audience is
- What level of detail is needed
- Whether the goal is inspiration or execution

---

### Sharing Projects

Sharing allows others to understand the project as a whole.

When sharing a project:
- Context is preserved
- Narrative intent remains visible
- Iteration history provides clarity

This reduces misinterpretation and repetitive explanation.

---

### Best Practices for Sharing

- Clean up unused explorations
- Highlight chosen directions
- Add brief clarifying notes if needed
- Share intent before detail

A clear story is more valuable than exhaustive output.

### From Tool to Communication

Scenographist is not just a generator.  
It is a **communication layer** between imagination and reality.

Saving preserves your thinking.  
Exporting clarifies it.  
Sharing allows it to move forward.
