## Discord & Community Spaces
Scenography principles can be applied to digital platforms to create immersive, engaging, and structured community experiences:

- **Spatial Organization:** Design channels, threads, and categories to guide conversation flow and accessibility  
- **Emotional Tone:** Use visuals, emojis, and tone of messaging to establish culture and mood  
- **Event & Interaction Design:** Craft interactive sessions, workshops, or live events with clear pathways for participation  
- **Community Journey:** Build onboarding, progression, and engagement sequences that keep members active and connected  

By treating digital spaces like physical ones, designers can create online communities that feel alive, immersive, and purposefully structured.
