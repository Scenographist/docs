Scene generation is the process of transforming a structured prompt into a coherent spatial world.  
In Scenographist, scenes are not isolated images — they are **designed environments** with logic, atmosphere, and narrative intent.

### What a Scene Represents

A scene is a complete spatial moment that includes:
- Architecture or spatial structure
- Materials and textures
- Light and atmosphere
- Emotional tone
- Implied or explicit human presence
- Narrative context

Scenes can represent:
- A single frozen moment
- A key narrative beat
- A space designed to evolve over time

### Core Inputs for Scene Generation

Scene generation relies on the prompt anatomy and modifiers working together.

Typical inputs include:
- Context and narrative intent
- Space type
- Emotion
- Materials
- Light
- Scale
- Optional modifiers (style, era, culture, weather)

Clear inputs produce coherent, intentional scenes.

### Levels of Scene Definition

Scene generation can happen at different levels of precision.

#### Conceptual

Used for early ideation and exploration.

Characteristics:
- Loose geometry
- Emphasis on mood and composition
- Abstract or symbolic materials
- Suggestive lighting

#### Spatial

Used for layout, proportion, and experiential clarity.

Characteristics:
- Defined volumes and circulation
- Clear scale relationships
- Material logic
- Lighting hierarchy

#### Production-ready

Used for downstream workflows and delivery.

Characteristics:
- Precise geometry
- Defined materials and finishes
- Lighting setups suitable for rendering
- Exportable outputs

### Iterative Scene Building

Scene generation is iterative by design.

Typical flow:
- Generate a base scene
- Refine emotion or lighting
- Adjust scale or materials
- Introduce or remove elements
- Transition toward technical precision if needed

Each iteration should modify one primary variable at a time.

### Scene Generation Best Practices

- Start with intent, not style
- Define emotion early
- Keep scale explicit
- Use modifiers sparingly
- Refine in small steps

### Example Scene Prompt

Example:
Immersive forest-edge performance space at dusk.  
Context: opening ritual of a contemporary performance.  
Emotion: quiet tension and anticipation.  
Materials: timber platforms, earth, suspended fabric.  
Light: low-angle natural light with subtle theatrical accents.  
Scale: human-scale pathways leading to a central gathering zone.
