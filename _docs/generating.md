## Generating Your First Scene

Generating your first scene is where Scenographist comes to life.  
This is the moment when a written intention becomes a **spatial world**.

You don’t need a perfect prompt — clarity grows through iteration.

---

### Step 1: Start with Intent

Begin by stating **what the scene is for** and **how it should feel**.

Focus on:
- Context
- Space type
- Emotion

Example:
Immersive performance space for a contemporary dance piece.  
Emotion: quiet tension and anticipation.

This is enough to begin.

---

### Step 2: Add Spatial Clarity

Once a base scene is generated, refine it by adding:
- Materials
- Light
- Scale

Example:
Materials: timber platforms and suspended fabric.  
Light: low-key theatrical lighting with soft shadows.  
Scale: human-scale center with elevated elements above.

Each addition sharpens the scene.

### Step 3: Use References (Optional)

Drag and drop references at any point:
- Moodboards
- Sketches
- Textures
- Plans

You can reference them directly:
- “Use the uploaded image for lighting mood”
- “Base proportions on the dragged sketch”

References reduce ambiguity and improve coherence.

### Step 4: Iterate, Don’t Restart

Avoid rewriting everything from scratch.

Instead:
- Adjust one variable at a time
- Ask for variations
- Compare outcomes

Examples:
- “Create a darker version”
- “Increase vertical scale”
- “Make the space feel more ceremonial”

Iteration is the intended workflow.

---

### Step 5: Recognize a Complete Scene

A scene is considered coherent when:
- The emotion is clear
- The space feels legible
- Materials and light support the narrative
- Scale feels intentional

At this point, you can:
- Generate variations
- Move toward technical detail
- Use the scene as a foundation for further work

### Common First-Time Tips

- Start simple
- Define emotion early
- Avoid stacking too many modifiers
- Let the scene evolve naturally
