## Architecture, Scale, Materiality
Spaces are the canvas of scenography. How they are designed determines how people move, feel, and interact within them. Key considerations include:

- **Architecture:** Define the structural layout, form, and style to support the story and function of the space  
- **Scale:** Consider proportions and dimensions to create intimacy, grandeur, or tension  
- **Materiality:** Choose textures, finishes, and surfaces that influence perception, touch, and atmosphere  

Through thoughtful manipulation of these elements, spaces become more than structures—they become immersive stages for experiences, guiding visitors while reinforcing narrative and emotion.
