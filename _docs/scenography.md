## Space as Storytelling
Every element within a space—light, texture, color, scale, and layout—contributes to a story. Scenography allows designers to:
- Guide movement and attention through spatial sequences
- Establish a narrative context without words
- Create immersive environments where visitors intuitively understand the intended story

## Emotion, Rhythm, Movement
Scenography shapes how people feel and interact within a space:
- **Emotion:** Lighting, color palettes, sound, and materials work together to evoke moods and feelings
- **Rhythm:** Spatial arrangements can create tension, release, or flow, much like beats in music
- **Movement:** Pathways, sightlines, and transitions choreograph how people move and experience the space, making the environment itself part of the narrative

By combining these elements, scenography turns ordinary spaces into immersive experiences that resonate with audiences, creating memories and emotional connections that endure long after the visit.
