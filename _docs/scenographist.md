**Scenographist** is an AI-assisted creative platform designed to explore, design, and articulate **spaces as narratives**.

It sits at the intersection of:

* **Scenography**
* **Architecture**
* **Experiential & spatial design**
* **World-building**

Rather than producing isolated images, Scenographist helps creators **think in worlds** — cohesive environments where space, light, material, atmosphere, and emotion work together to tell a story.

## From Concept to World-Building

Traditional design tools often focus on form, plans, or static visuals.
Scenographist starts earlier — at the **intent and imagination stage**.

With Scenographist, you can:

* Translate abstract ideas into spatial concepts
* Explore multiple creative directions in minutes
* Design environments as lived experiences, not just objects
* Iterate rapidly before committing to technical development

The workflow follows a simple but powerful logic:

**Idea → World → Space → Atmosphere → Experience**

## AI as a Creative Partner

Scenographist does not replace designers — it **augments creative thinking**.

AI is used to:

* Accelerate ideation
* Expand visual exploration
* Reveal unexpected scenographic directions
* Support storytelling through space

The result is a tool that feels less like software, and more like a **collaborative creative assistant** for designers, architects, and storytellers.
