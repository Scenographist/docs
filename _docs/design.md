## Design Iteration Workflows

Advanced use of Scenographist is less about generating more scenes  
and more about **iterating with intention**.

Design iteration workflows help you move from exploration to decision-making while preserving clarity and narrative coherence.

---

### Iteration as a System

Iteration is most effective when it follows a structure.

Instead of changing everything at once:
- Define a baseline scene
- Isolate one variable
- Generate controlled variations
- Compare outcomes
- Decide and lock direction

This mirrors real-world design processes.

---

### Workflow 1: Baseline → Variations → Selection

1. Generate a clear baseline scene  
2. Create 3–5 variations, each changing a single parameter  
3. Review differences in emotion, legibility, and coherence  
4. Select one direction to continue  

Example variations:
- Lighting shift
- Material palette reduction
- Scale adjustment

---

### Workflow 2: Mood-First Iteration

1. Fix space type and geometry  
2. Iterate primarily on mood  
3. Observe emotional impact  
4. Choose the emotional direction  
5. Refine form and material afterward  

This workflow is useful for:
- Performative spaces
- Ritual or ceremonial environments
- Brand or experiential installations

---

### Workflow 3: Style Exploration

1. Lock narrative and mood  
2. Generate stylistic interpretations  
3. Compare visual language  
4. Select one dominant style  
5. Remove or simplify secondary influences  

Avoid mixing styles too early.

---

### Workflow 4: Light-Led Refinement

1. Keep geometry and materials constant  
2. Generate lighting variations  
3. Compare spatial readability and mood  
4. Select lighting strategy  
5. Adjust materials only if needed  

Lighting often resolves issues more effectively than form changes.

---

### Workflow 5: Scale & Proportion Testing

1. Start with human-scale reference  
2. Generate expanded and compressed versions  
3. Observe impact on emotion and movement  
4. Select appropriate scale  
5. Refine circulation and thresholds  

Scale decisions should support narrative intent.

---

### Tracking Decisions

As iteration progresses:
- Acknowledge chosen directions explicitly
- Refer back to selected versions
- Avoid reopening settled parameters unnecessarily

Example:
“Keep the lighting approach from version two and continue refining materials.”

### When to Stop Iterating

Iteration should narrow possibilities, not multiply them indefinitely.

Stop when:
- Emotional intent is clear
- Spatial logic is legible
- Changes become marginal
- Further variation adds confusion
