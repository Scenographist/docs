Scenographist follows a clear creative progression, helping you move from intention to immersive output.

### Prompt
Start with a simple idea, intention, or question. Describe the mood, purpose, context, or constraints — in natural language.

### World
The prompt expands into a coherent world: its rules, identity, atmosphere, references, and underlying logic.

### Space
Within the world, specific spaces are defined. Architecture, layout, materials, light, sound, and scale are shaped in context.

### Story
Spaces are connected through narrative and experience. This layer defines meaning, emotion, sequence, and user journey over time.

### Visuals
Finally, ideas are translated into visual outputs: illustrations, concept frames, moodboards, and spatial representations ready for exploration or presentation.
