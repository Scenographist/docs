## Day/Night, Artificial vs Natural Light
Light defines how a space is perceived and experienced. Scenographers manipulate light to guide attention, create mood, and reinforce storytelling:

- **Day/Night:** Use natural light cycles or simulated timing to evoke realism, rhythm, and emotional tone  
- **Artificial vs Natural Light:** Balance artificial lighting, projections, and natural light to highlight key elements, create depth, and shape atmosphere  

Thoughtful control of light and atmosphere transforms environments, making them feel alive, dynamic, and emotionally resonant.
