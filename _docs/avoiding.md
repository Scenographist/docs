## Avoiding Visual Clichés
To make spaces memorable, designers must move beyond predictable or overused visuals. Avoiding clichés ensures that each environment feels fresh, intentional, and impactful:

- **Innovative Thinking:** Challenge standard motifs, tropes, and design shortcuts  
- **Contextual Design:** Let the narrative, audience, and site guide your visual choices  
- **Subtle Storytelling:** Focus on layered details, emotion, and atmosphere rather than obvious imagery  
- **Iterative Exploration:** Test and refine ideas to discover unique solutions that resonate  

By consciously avoiding clichés, scenographers create spaces that feel authentic, immersive, and full of originality.
