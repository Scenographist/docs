Iteration is a core principle of Scenographist.  
Rather than aiming for a perfect result in a single prompt, scenes evolve through **small, intentional adjustments**.

Variations allow you to explore alternatives without losing the original intent.

### Why Iteration Matters

Spatial design is relational.  
Changing one element often affects several others.

Iteration helps you:
- Test ideas quickly
- Compare emotional outcomes
- Refine clarity and coherence
- Move from concept to production

### What to Iterate

Effective iteration focuses on **one variable at a time**.

Common iteration targets:
- Emotion (increase tension, soften mood)
- Light (contrast, direction, time of day)
- Materials (raw → refined, opaque → translucent)
- Scale (compression vs openness)
- Density of elements
- Degree of abstraction

### Variation Strategies

Use variations to explore controlled alternatives.

#### Mood Variations

Keep the same space, change the emotional tone.

Example:
- Version A: tense and compressed  
- Version B: calm and open  

#### Style Variations

Keep mood constant, change stylistic language.

Example:
- Minimalist interpretation  
- Brutalist interpretation  

#### Light Variations

Keep geometry and materials constant, vary lighting.

Example:
- Daylight version  
- Nocturnal theatrical version  

#### Scale Variations

Test different spatial relationships.

Example:
- Human-scale intimate version  
- Monumental ceremonial version  

### Iterative Prompting Patterns

Useful phrasing for iteration:
- “Generate a variation with softer lighting”
- “Keep everything the same but increase vertical scale”
- “Create an alternative version with a colder mood”
- “Reduce material palette to two elements”

### Comparing Variations

When reviewing multiple outputs:
- Compare emotional clarity
- Check spatial legibility
- Evaluate narrative alignment
- Identify unintended conflicts

Select the version that best supports the core intent.

### From Iteration to Decision

Iteration is not endless exploration.  
It is a process of **progressive narrowing**.

Once a direction is clear:
- Lock core parameters
- Move toward technical precision
- Prepare for production or export
