Prompt templates provide reusable structures that help maintain clarity, intention, and consistency when working with Scenographist.  
They are starting points — meant to be refined iteratively through conversation.

### Minimal

Use this template for fast ideation, early exploration, or when you want to stay intentionally open-ended.

Focus:
- Space type
- Core emotion
- One or two defining qualities

Template structure:
- Space type
- Emotional intent
- Key material, light, or spatial gesture

Example:
Immersive black box stage designed to feel tense and intimate, using raw concrete surfaces and a single directional spotlight.

### Narrative-driven

Use this template when storytelling, sequencing, and emotional progression are central to the project.

Focus:
- Context and narrative moment
- Emotional journey
- Interaction between space, materials, and light

Template structure:
- Context or narrative situation
- Space type
- Emotional transition
- Materials and light as narrative tools
- Overall mood

Example:
Final act of a contemporary dance performance.  
An immersive stage that guides the audience from tension to release, using suspended fabric, shifting shadows, and gradually softening light.  
Overall mood: cathartic and calm.

### Technical

Use this template when precision, production-readiness, or interoperability with other tools is required.

Focus:
- Clear spatial definition
- Materials and lighting specifications
- Scale, dimensions, and output constraints

Template structure:
- Space type and dimensions
- Material specifications
- Lighting setup
- Scale reference
- Output requirements

Example:
Generate a modular scenographic stage measuring 12m × 12m × 6m.  
Materials: black-painted steel truss and birch plywood platforms.  
Lighting: programmable overhead spotlights with soft ambient fill.  
Scale: human-scale center with elevated elements above.  
Output: production-ready render at 8K resolution.
