With Scenographist, you don’t just design objects or layouts — you design **experiences**.  
The platform helps you shape coherent spatial narratives across multiple scales.

### Worlds
Create complete, self-consistent universes with their own logic, mood, materials, and cultural identity. Ideal for festivals, films, brands, games, or speculative architecture.

### Spaces
Design physical or hybrid environments such as rooms, stages, installations, buildings, or landscapes. Explore form, light, texture, sound, and flow before committing to production.

### Atmospheres
Define the emotional layer of a place — lighting, color palettes, acoustics, weather, density, and rhythm. Atmosphere is treated as a first-class design element, not an afterthought.

### Journeys
Map how people move, feel, and experience space over time. From arrival to departure, choreograph transitions, moments, and memories as part of a cohesive spatial story.
