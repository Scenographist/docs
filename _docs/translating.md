## Translating Visuals into Real-World Builds
Creating immersive environments requires turning conceptual visuals into functional, real-world spaces. Scenographers bridge imagination and construction by considering practicalities without sacrificing storytelling:

- **Material & Structural Feasibility:** Choose materials and techniques that realize the vision safely and sustainably  
- **Scale & Proportions:** Ensure dimensions and spatial relationships translate accurately from concept to build  
- **Technical Collaboration:** Work with architects, engineers, and fabricators to preserve design intent  
- **Experience Retention:** Maintain the narrative, mood, and emotional impact of the original concept in the final space  

By carefully translating visuals into real-world builds, designers ensure that immersive experiences are both achievable and faithful to their creative vision.
