Projects are the structural backbone of Scenographist.  
They define **where ideas live**, how they evolve, and how context is preserved over time.

Understanding how projects work will help you stay organized, iterate effectively, and maintain narrative clarity.

### Projects as Design Containers

A project is more than a folder.  
It is a **living design environment**.

Each project holds:
- A continuous chat conversation
- All uploaded references
- Generated scenes and variations
- Iterative refinements and decisions

This continuity allows the system to understand intent across time.

---

### Persistent Context

Unlike one-off prompts, projects preserve context.

This means:
- Earlier decisions influence later outputs
- You can refer back to previous scenes
- Iterations remain coherent
- Narrative logic stays intact

You can say:
- “Go back to the second version”
- “Refine the lighting from earlier”
- “Keep the same scale as before”

The project remembers.

### Projects vs. Variations

Use a single project when:
- Exploring multiple variations of the same idea
- Refining one narrative direction
- Moving from concept to production

Create a new project when:
- The story or purpose changes
- You switch to a new client or production
- You want a clean conceptual break

Think of projects as **worlds**, and variations as **paths within them**.

---

### Long-Term Evolution

Projects support long-term thinking.

Over time, a project may:
- Start as a loose concept
- Develop into a spatial language
- Gain technical precision
- Become production-ready

Nothing is lost — earlier versions remain accessible.

---

### Collaboration & Handover (Conceptual)

Projects are designed to support:
- Clear communication of intent
- Review and comparison of directions
- Smooth transition to production teams

Even when shared, a project retains:
- Narrative clarity
- Design rationale
- Decision history

---

### Naming and Structure Best Practices

- Use descriptive, intent-driven names
- Avoid generic titles like “Test” or “New Concept”
- Keep related explorations together
- Archive finished projects instead of deleting them

---

### Mental Model

If chat is the conversation,  
and prompts are the language,  
**projects are the memory**.

They ensure that spatial ideas grow with coherence, intention, and depth.
