## Client Pitch Workflows

Scenographist is a powerful tool for client pitches because it preserves **intent, narrative, and evolution** — not just final visuals.

Effective pitch workflows focus on **clarity over volume** and **story over options**.

---

### Pitch Mindset

A client pitch is not a design review.

The goal is to:
- Communicate intent
- Build emotional alignment
- Show confidence in direction
- Reduce ambiguity

Use Scenographist to guide the client, not overwhelm them.

### Workflow 1: Narrative-First Pitch

1. Define the core story  
2. Generate a single strong baseline scene  
3. Refine mood and atmosphere  
4. Export only the most coherent version  

This workflow is ideal when:
- The project is early-stage
- Emotional buy-in is critical
- The client is not design-trained

---

### Workflow 2: Controlled Option Pitch

1. Establish a clear baseline  
2. Generate 2–3 deliberate variations  
3. Label each option by intent, not style  
4. Present differences clearly  

Example:
- Option A: Intimate and contemplative  
- Option B: Open and celebratory  

Avoid presenting more than three options.

---

### Workflow 3: Journey-Based Pitch

1. Define the visitor or user journey  
2. Generate key scenes along that path  
3. Ensure emotional progression  
4. Present scenes as moments, not assets  

This works well for:
- Exhibitions
- Hospitality
- Events and festivals
- Branded experiences

---

### Workflow 4: Live Iteration Pitch

1. Present a prepared baseline  
2. Invite controlled feedback  
3. Iterate live on one parameter  
4. Demonstrate responsiveness  

This builds trust while maintaining authority.

Use sparingly and intentionally.

### Preparing a Pitch Project

Before sharing:
- Remove exploratory noise
- Highlight chosen directions
- Add short intent descriptions
- Ensure visual and narrative coherence

A clean project signals confidence.

---

### What Clients Care About

Clients respond to:
- How the space will feel
- How it supports their goals
- Whether the idea is clear
- Whether decisions feel intentional

They care less about process than outcome.

---

### Common Pitch Mistakes

- Showing too many variations
- Explaining every iteration
- Changing direction mid-pitch
- Letting the tool lead the narrative

You lead. The tool supports.
