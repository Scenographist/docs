## Designing with Intention
Scenography is most powerful when every choice has purpose. Designing with intention ensures that spaces, interactions, and journeys resonate deeply with audiences:

- **Purposeful Decisions:** Consider how every element—light, material, scale, and flow—supports the story and emotional experience  
- **Audience Awareness:** Anticipate how visitors perceive and interact with the space to maximize engagement  
- **Consistency & Coherence:** Align narrative, mood, and spatial design to create a unified experience  
- **Reflection & Iteration:** Continuously refine designs to enhance impact and achieve intended outcomes  

By designing with intention, every environment becomes more than a space—it becomes a meaningful, immersive experience that leaves a lasting impression.
