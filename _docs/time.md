## Ephemeral vs Permanent Spaces
Time shapes how spaces are conceived and experienced. Scenographers consider duration and transformation to enhance narrative and engagement:

- **Ephemeral Spaces:** Temporary installations, performances, or pop-ups that create intensity, surprise, and fleeting emotional impact  
- **Permanent Spaces:** Long-lasting environments that evolve slowly, offering familiarity, continuity, and lasting resonance  

By designing with time in mind, spaces can tell stories that are immediate or enduring, creating experiences that are either momentary or timeless.
