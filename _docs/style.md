Style and mood control allow you to steer the emotional and aesthetic direction of a scene without changing its core intent.  
In Scenographist, **mood defines how a space feels**, while **style defines how that feeling is expressed**.

They should reinforce the narrative — not replace it.

### Mood Control

Mood shapes the emotional experience of a space over time.

Use mood to control:
- Emotional intensity
- Sense of comfort or tension
- Perceived openness or compression
- Atmosphere and presence

Common mood descriptors:
- Calm
- Tense
- Sacred
- Oppressive
- Intimate
- Joyful
- Melancholic
- Euphoric

Tip:
Avoid vague terms. Choose moods that imply spatial consequences.

### Style Control

Style defines the visual and formal language through which mood is expressed.

Use style to influence:
- Geometry and form
- Material expression
- Ornamentation or restraint
- Visual references

Common styles:
- Minimalist
- Brutalist
- Expressionist
- Biophilic
- Cyberpunk
- Classical
- Industrial

Tip:
One dominant style is usually enough. Layering too many reduces clarity.

### Separating Mood from Style

Mood and style are related but not interchangeable.

Example:
- Mood: sacred and quiet  
- Style: minimalist  

This results in a very different space than:
- Mood: sacred and quiet  
- Style: baroque  

Always define mood first, then choose a style that supports it.

### Mood Through Light and Space

Mood is often best controlled indirectly.

Key levers:
- Light intensity and contrast
- Shadow depth
- Ceiling height and enclosure
- Material reflectivity

Subtle adjustments can dramatically change emotional impact.

### Gradual Mood Transitions

Scenes can evolve emotionally.

Use transitions to:
- Move from tension to release
- Shift from darkness to clarity
- Guide focus and attention

Describe transitions explicitly when needed.

Example:
The space begins compressed and dim, gradually opening into a softly lit central volume.

### Example Style & Mood Prompt
