In Scenographist, prompts act as **design briefs**, not simple visual descriptions.  
They translate narrative intent, spatial logic, and emotional direction into structured inputs.

A strong prompt is composed of the following elements. You may use all of them or only a few, depending on the project.

### Context
Defines the narrative and purpose of the space.  
Describe why the space exists, the story it belongs to, and the moment it represents.

### Space Type
Specifies the spatial typology and functional category.  
This anchors proportions, circulation, and architectural logic.

### Emotion
Describes how the space should make people feel.  
Emotion guides composition, contrast, rhythm, and spatial tension.

### Materials
Defines the physical or symbolic material palette.  
Materials affect texture, realism, light behavior, and atmosphere.

### Light
Controls how the space is revealed and perceived.  
Lighting is a primary narrative and scenographic tool.

### Scale
Defines proportion and spatial relationship to the human body.  
Scale influences intimacy, monumentality, and emotional impact.
