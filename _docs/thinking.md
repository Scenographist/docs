## Thinking in Journeys, Not Images
Effective scenography focuses on how people move through and experience a space, rather than isolated visuals. Designing with journey-first thinking ensures the narrative unfolds naturally:

- **Sequential Experience:** Consider the order and timing of spaces, views, and interactions  
- **Emotional Arc:** Plan moments of tension, surprise, calm, or delight to guide visitor feelings  
- **Movement & Flow:** Design pathways, sightlines, and transitions that feel intuitive and engaging  
- **Holistic Perspective:** Integrate architecture, lighting, sound, and interactivity into a continuous, immersive experience  

By thinking in journeys instead of static images, designers create spaces that are alive, dynamic, and memorable.
