Prompt modifiers are optional layers that refine, enrich, or contextualize a base prompt.  
They should be used **after** the core anatomy (context, space, emotion, materials, light, scale) is defined.

Modifiers help steer aesthetics and atmosphere without overriding intent.

### Style

Defines the visual or spatial language of the space.

Use style to influence:
- Formal expression
- Level of abstraction
- Artistic or architectural references

Examples:
- Minimalist
- Brutalist
- Baroque
- Futuristic
- Cyberpunk
- Biophilic
- Expressionist

### Era

Anchors the space in a specific time period or imagined future.

Use era to shape:
- Material choices
- Proportions and ornamentation
- Technological presence or absence

Examples:
- Ancient
- Medieval
- Industrial Revolution
- Mid-century modern
- Contemporary
- Near-future
- Far-future

### Culture

Introduces cultural references, symbolism, and spatial behaviors.

Use culture to inform:
- Geometry and ornament
- Ritual, movement, and social use of space
- Color, material, and pattern logic

Examples:
- Japanese
- Mediterranean
- Nordic
- Middle Eastern
- West African
- Indigenous
- Global hybrid

### Weather

Adds environmental and atmospheric conditions that affect mood and perception.

Use weather to influence:
- Lighting conditions
- Material response
- Emotional tone

Examples:
- Foggy morning
- Heavy rain
- Snowfall
- Harsh sunlight
- Windy dusk
- Humid tropical air

## Common Mistakes

Understanding common mistakes helps improve results quickly and consistently.

### Overloading the Prompt

Including too many styles, emotions, or conflicting references leads to incoherent outputs.

Tip:
Focus on one primary intent and layer modifiers gradually.

### Vague Emotional Direction

Generic terms like “nice,” “cool,” or “beautiful” provide little guidance.

Tip:
Use precise emotional language (e.g. oppressive, serene, ceremonial).

### Conflicting Scale Signals

Mixing human-scale intimacy with monumental language without intent creates confusion.

Tip:
Explicitly define scale relationships and hierarchy.

### Treating Prompts as Image Descriptions

Scenographist is designed for spatial thinking, not surface visuals.

Tip:
Describe space, movement, and experience — not just appearance.

## Prompt Examples by Discipline

These examples show how the same prompting principles adapt across disciplines.

### Scenography & Performance

Example:
Immersive stage for a contemporary theater performance, focused on ritual and transformation.  
Emotion: tension evolving into release.  
Materials: raw timber, fabric, and steel.  
Lighting: low-key theatrical light with gradual warm transition.  
Scale: human-scale center with elevated symbolic elements.

### Architecture

Example:
Public pavilion designed as a place of pause and gathering.  
Emotion: calm and openness.  
Materials: exposed concrete, wood, and glass.  
Light: natural daylight with soft shadow gradients.  
Scale: generous human scale with clear structural rhythm.

### Exhibition & Installation

Example:
Immersive exhibition space exploring memory and time.  
Emotion: introspective and slightly disorienting.  
Materials: translucent panels and reflective surfaces.  
Light: layered projections and ambient glow.  
Scale: compressed circulation opening into a central volume.

### Hospitality & Events

Example:
Wedding reception space designed as a nocturnal garden.  
Emotion: intimate and celebratory.  
Materials: natural stone, greenery, and soft textiles.  
Lighting: warm string lights and candle-like points.  
Scale: human-scale dining zones within an open landscape.

### Film & Visual Storytelling

Example:
Cinematic interior for a sci-fi narrative.  
Emotion: isolation and awe.  
Materials: metallic surfaces and glass.  
Lighting: high-contrast directional light with volumetric haze.  
Scale: monumental architecture dwarfing the character.
