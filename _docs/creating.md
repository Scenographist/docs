## Creating Your First Project

Projects are the foundation of how work is organized in Scenographist.  
Each project acts as a **dedicated workspace** where conversations, references, and generated scenes stay connected.

Creating a project before you start prompting helps maintain clarity and continuity as ideas evolve.

---

### What a Project Is

A project groups everything related to a single idea, client, or exploration.

A project contains:
- A persistent chat history
- Uploaded references and assets
- Generated scenes and variations
- Iterations over time

This allows you to experiment freely without losing earlier directions.

### Creating a New Project

To create your first project:
- Open the dashboard
- Go to the Projects sidebar on the left
- Select “New Project”
- Give your project a clear, descriptive name

Good project names reflect intent, not just form.

Examples:
- Immersive Forest Performance
- Contemporary Opera – Act I
- Biophilic Pavilion Concept
- Wedding Ceremony – Night Garden

---

### Starting a Conversation

Once a project is created, the chat is empty and ready.

Begin by describing:
- The context or goal
- The type of space
- The desired emotion

You do not need a perfect prompt — iteration is expected.

Example:
Immersive performance space for a contemporary dance piece, focused on ritual and transformation.

From there, refine through follow-up messages.

---

### Adding References Early

Drag and drop references at any time:
- Moodboards
- Sketches
- Textures
- Plans or diagrams

Early references help anchor the project and reduce ambiguity.

You can refer to them directly in chat:
- “Use the uploaded image for lighting mood”
- “Base proportions on the dragged sketch”

---

### Iterating Within a Project

Projects are designed for evolution.

Within a single project, you can:
- Generate multiple scene variations
- Explore different moods or styles
- Refine scale, materials, or light
- Move from conceptual to technical outputs

All iterations remain accessible in the project timeline.

---

### When to Create a New Project

Create a new project when:
- The narrative intent changes significantly
- You want to explore a radically different direction
- You are starting work for a new client or production

For small variations, stay within the same project.

---

### Best Practices

- One project per core idea
- Name projects clearly
- Add references early
- Iterate in small steps
- Let the project evolve organically
